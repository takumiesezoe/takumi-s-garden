There is a lack of purpose in my life

Seems I am the most useless alive

Emptiness crawling down my spine

A hollow echo I can't define

  

Its always the same, it doesn't stop repeating

Of a glance of fame I can't stop dreaming

But shadows whisper louder than the cheers

Feeding my doubts, confirming my fears
